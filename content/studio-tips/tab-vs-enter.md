# Tab vs. Enter for autocomplete

Enter can be used to select an item from an auto complete list. When enter is used, the selected item will simply be inserted into the text at the cursors current position. Pressing tab as a way of selecting an autocomplete list item, however, will replace the symbol currently underneath the cursor with the one that you've selected from the autocomplete list.
