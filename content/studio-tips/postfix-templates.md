# Postfix Templates

Sometimes you need a live template to be applied to a particular variable that you're working with. This can be accomplished through the use of Postfix Templates. As the name suggests, these templates are invoked by *appending* a period to the variable you want to invoke a template on. After appending the period, invoke autocomplete to see the list of available postfix templates.
