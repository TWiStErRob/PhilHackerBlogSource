I just finished Eric Reis' _The Startup Way_, which focuses on how to get lean practices implemented at existing companies. I picked up the book because I moved into a product management role earlier this year and I figured it would contain some useful lessons for me as as product manager. Here are some of my takeaways.

### Politics

The best parts of the book for me were often minor comments Reis made about how _political_ people can be when they're trying to avoid deep changes that are necessary for companies to innovate with their products and business. I tend to think that politics are under-covered in business books[^1], so it was refreshing to see Reis tackle those issues in a real context. That real context is Reis' accounts of how Reis helped GE, a massive company with plenty of people that have plenty to be political about, transform into an lean organization.

Here are a couple of the comments I found interesting: 

* In the context of discussion about how companies shouldn't fund projects that aren't promising, Reis notes that it can difficult to pull this off because, "most subordinates have elevated convincing their boss to fund their projects to a high art."[^2]
* While discussing the value of having sr. company leaders review the progress of teams, he says that this, "forces middle managers to think carefully about whether they really, truly have a problem because asking for status updates from high-level executes is much more expensive, politically speaking."[^3]

And here's an interesting story about how one manager cleverly responded to some political obstacles he faced:

>His project had run into political difficulties and was viewed as a failure by some of the executives in his division. Rather than risk it being canceled, Mahan took it underground, with a team of volunteers who continued to do their day jobs but kept the project alive on the side...He did a sort of skunkworks with Lean Startup, and it ended up getting him promoted.[^4]

Sometimes product managers need to push their organizations in new directions, and its great to see examples of how this can play out that include details about the political nuances in change-situations. Even better: the people in Reis' stories are politically aware without sinking into the sketchy kind of politics. That's ☝️ the sweet spot for organizational change efforts, I think. 

### (Perverse) Incentives

Even when people aren't being political, they are understandably self-interested, so perverse incentives can really stifle innovation if we're not careful, according to Reis. 

A nice example of this is Reis' suggestion that the way that departments receive funding in large organizations provides perverse incentives to avoid innovation. Reis calls this method of funding "entitlement funding" since departments are usually able to keep their funding once their expenses are in the budget regardless of how well they perform. If departments will receive funding regardless of the business impact of their activities, why focus on innovation? Reis has a great bit about how organizations with entitlement funding have incentives to do just the opposite:

>Let's think about the incentives that entitlement funding creates for project teams. Imagine a team that is debating whether to launch a product now or to delay a little longer. In terms of the the team's budget, it's almost always a good idea to delay. If you launch now, you risk catastrophic failure and project cancellation. If you delay, you may face some criticism from management, but as long as your reasons are sound (and there are always an infinite number of sound reasons to call upon), you'll most likely live to fight another day. And with a delay, you may be able to make the product more perfect, increasing odds of success in the future.[^5] 

Reis contrasts this funding strategy with something called "metered funding." Metered funding works the same way funding works for startups: there's a board that oversees the progress of the startup and the startup must meet certain milestones before they can receive additional funding. If the project doesn't meet those milestones before they run out of money, the project is cancelled.

Still, I think its great idea. I've worked for startups and established companies and I think a part of the reason that working for startups is more fun, meaningful, and useful for me is that there's a _sense of urgency_ that pushes me to be at the top of my game and to produce something that actually has value. Reis puts this point well:

>There's really no substitute for being able to say: "Listen, we only have enough cash to stay in business for another six weeks. I know there are a lot of things we'd love to be able to do, but if we don't make at least one of these things work before then, we're doomed." ...[Startups offer] one of the only environments in which there is a countervailing force constantly working against scope creep.[^6]

Stepping back from the details of Reis' suggestions and observations, here's the lesson for me: insofar as product managers are concerned with innovation, they have to be aware of both the politics and the incentives at play within an organization and how those things can impact the extent to which their company can innovate.

### There's another conception of product management


### Corporate Transformation is Product Management
