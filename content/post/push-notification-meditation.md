<!-- self-knowledge 
  relates to limits of what we can know
  relates to the extent to which we can control ourselves

poor scores on self-knowledge leads to poor self-control and epistemic humility, which in turn leads to bad decisions
this is the dominant way of living today and those how understand why this is fucked
are in a position appreciate one of the more tragic and surprising facts about being human today:  -->

A few months ago, I stumbled upon something I found hard to believe: 

**Some people continue smoking (cigarettes) because they are unaware of how bad it tastes.**

Although it was counter-intuitive, I had pretty good reason to believe it, as it was suggested by Judson Brewer, a psychiatrist who developed a mindfulness-based smoking cessation program that's supposedly superior to the standard smoking cessation program developed by the American Lung Assocation. In his book, _The Craving Mind_, he said while he was first piloting the program:

>...people would come back with reports of noticing how many times they smoked out of boredom. One gentleman cut down from thirty cigarettes to ten because he realized that the majority of his smoking was either habitual or a "solution" to fix other problems. For example, he smoked to cover up the bitter taste of coffee. With this simple realization, he started brushing his teeth instead. Perhaps more interesting were the reports I got from participants about what it was like to pay attention when they smoked. Many of them couldn't believe how their eyes had been opened; they had never realized how bad smoking tasted. One of my favorite responses: "Smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals. Yuck."[^1]

He goes on to suggest that there's a relationship between these realizations (facilitated by mindfulness) and smoking cessation. "Nonsense," I thought.

That skepticism changed a few weeks ago while I was meditating and my phone chimed. I learned that I --- like the smoker in Brewer's study --- had a rather shocking ignorance about the unpleasant aspects of my (smartphone) addiction.[^3] 

[Plenty](https://wellbeing.google/) [of](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/opinion/you-love-your-iphone-literally.html) [ink](https://www.amazon.com/Craving-Mind-Cigarettes-Smartphones-Hooked/dp/0300223242) has been spilt on our unhealthy attachment to our phones, so I won't spend any time on that here. I'm more interested in what addictions in general say about the limits of our self-knowledge, the relationship between self-knowledge and self-control, and the importance of mindfulness. 

To explore that, I want to talk a little bit more about the experience of receiving a text message while meditating, and discuss why that experience has led me to feel more confident that meditation is a good use of my time.

## Self-knowledge

>I must first know myself, as the Delphian inscription says; to be curious about that which is not my concern, while I am still in ignorance of my own self, would be ridiculous. And therefore I bid farewell to all this...I want to know not about this, but about myself: am I a monster more complicated and swollen with passion than the serpent Typho, or a creature of a gentler and simpler sort, to whom Nature has given a diviner and lowlier destiny?

>--- Plato's Socrates, ["Phaedrus"](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedrus.html)

Now, I didn't reject Brewer's claim because I'm some naiv√® soul who thinks that human cognition is limitless and that people are near-perfectly rational. I was a big fan of [skepticism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/#PhiSkeVsOrdInc) back in my philosophy days, and more recently, I've been getting a kick out of hearing about studies that suggest that we don't know as much about ourselves as we'd like to think.[^2] Still, until recently, I found it hard to believe that someone could be unaware of something so intense as the _taste of her cigarette_ as she smoked.

## Paying attention to receiving a text message


When I received the text message, I was pretty deep in to my meditation session. I was actually eagerly anticipating the message because I thought it may contain some feedback about some work I'd done recently that I was insecure about. I was so insecure about this work, in fact, that I had lost a bit of sleep over it the night prior. In spite of this, the meditation session was going quite well. I'd managed to maintain a decent focus on my breathing and my body felt very relaxed. 

When the text message came in, I almost grabbed my phone without thinking about it. I could feel my muscles tensing up in anticipation of grabbing my phone. I also felt a sort of mildly pleasant adrenaline rush like I was on a split-second roller-coaster or something. Presumably, this feeling was what Brewer calls a "dopamine spritz" that often accompanies responding to my phone (and also accompanies our responses to a variety of other addictive stimuli).

I found the intensity of these aspects of my experience rather shocking. I receive text messages all the time and --- being the angsty person that I am --- this certainly isn't the first time that I've been eagerly anticipating a message on the heels of some anxiety-induced lost sleep. In spite of all those previous occurrences, I'd never noticed how it really felt to receive a message I was eagerly anticipating.

I didn't answer my phone, and I pretty quickly concluded that the experience of receiving the message --- in spite of the brief, mildly pleasant rush --- was actually rather unpleasant overall. I was enjoying being at peace and being relaxed and then all the sudden I was jolted into a nearly involuntary frenzy to grab my phone.

All of this made the surprising remark I found in Brewer's book believable. It turned out that I was just like the smoker in Brewer's study. I didn't notice the _intensely_ unpleasant aspects of a common experience that I had, even though those aspects were fairly obvious once I managed to just pay a little more attention to the experience itself.

## Why this matters

[As I've said before]({{< ref "my-first-1000-minutes-meditating.md" >}}), I started meditating because I was looking for a more efficient way to relax. This recent experience, however, has shown me that relaxation is really only the beginning of the benefits of meditating.

One of the more surprising and tragic things about being human right now is that we're keenly aware of the extent to which we've managed to build a world --- a home --- that is so alien from the one in which we evolved that do not know how to live well in it.

[^3]: This shouldn't have surprised me, as one of the central themes of Brewer's book is that addiction aquisition and disruption happen via common psychological mechanisms regardless of the thing to which we are addicted.
