title = "Business and the Cartesian Demon: How not to Study Business"
+++

A few hundred years ago, Renè Descartes, the fella who brought us the Cartesian coordinate system 📉, isolated himself for a while to figure out (among other things) whether we can know anything for certain. The result of his retreat was his _Meditations on First Philosophy_, one of the most important philosophical texts of the modern era and one of my personal favorites. 

Early on in his _Meditations_, he decides that it'd be useful to engage in a thought experiment. He says,

>...I shall suppose that some malicious, powerful, cunning demon 😈 has done all he can to deceive me...I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things are merely dreams that the demon has contrived as traps for my judgment. I shall consider myself as having no hands or eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as having falsely believed that I had all these things.

Again, Descartes invokes the demon to figure out if there's anything that can be known with absolute certainty. He finds that even if an all-powerful demon attempts to deceive him about everything he believes, there's one thing he can know with certainty: he knows that he exists. Even if the demon deceives him about everything else, he can still be certain that he exists since deception presupposes someone who is being deceived. This thought eventually leads him to the famous "I think, therefore I am" conclusion. 🤔

Hold that ☝️️ thought for a second.

Lately, I've been questioning a lot of the lessons I _think_ I've learned about business over the past couple years. Between my second reading of _Thinking Fast and Slow_, a book about how our minds trick us into believing silly things, and my recent first reading of _Leadership BS_, a book about how many of the leadership/business focused content we consume are little more than bull-shit, feel-good stories devoid of any real scientific backing, I've started to worry that my attempts at learning about business are misguided, that I'm a fool looking for knowledge where there is none to be had. 🤷‍♂️

I see my worry as similar to the one that led Descartes' to write his _Meditations_. They are both worries about what can be known given imperfections in our sources of information. The only difference is that my worry is scoped to business-related knowledge instead of knowledge in general.

Since my worry is similar to Descartes', I figured it'd be helpful and fun to use the same sort of thought experiment to address it. The demon is really a sort of colorful abstraction over the various imperfections of our sources of information.

To address his worries about what can be known in general, Descartes imagined an all-powerful demon and asked if there was any knowledge that would be safe from his power. Similarly, to address my worries about what can be known about business, in the first section of this essay, I'll sketch a demon who has the power to trick us in two ways we are often mislead. We'll look briefly at some of the ways we're mislead by feel-good stories and imagined causal forces. 

Next, I'll explicitly point out the pieces of knowledge that can't withstand the demons powers. In other words, I'll point out that some of the things we thought we knew are actually BS. I'll list out a bunch of books (e.g., _How Google Works_, _Exponential Organizations_, etc.) that I've read over the past few years that I've probably taken too seriously as guides to business.

## Our Cartesian Demon

What powers shall we give to our demon? Again, we're giving him powers that correspond to imperfections in our information about business and imperfections in how we _process_ that information. Let's start with the over-representation of information that makes us feel good and how that over-representation translates into errors of judgement. 

### The Demon's Temptations of Self-indulgence

One of the most useful points of _Leadership BS_ is Pfeffer's argument that because people who create leadership content are often trying to make money 💰, we should be suspicious of the content itself.[^1] In particular, we should expect information that makes us feel good to be over-represented since feel-good stories sell better.

What information would make us feel good? How about an outsized picture of how important our contributions are as leaders to our organization? Mmm...yes please. That does feel good. Here's Pfeffer on this:

>The word “leadership” is prominent in part because many people, both scholars and practitioners, view leadership as a construct important if not fundamental to explaining business and organizational performance. This unequivocal belief in the importance of leadership persists, even if the scientific evidence on the point is much more mixed.[^2]

Kahneman makes the same point in _Thinking Fast and Slow_ and he actually cites one of the studies that Pfeffer may have had in mind:

>A very generous estimate of the correlation between the success of the firm and the quality of its CEO might be as high as .30...To appreciate the significance of this number, consider the following question: Suppose you consider many pairs of firms. The two firms in each pair are generally similar, but the CEO of one of them is better than the other. How often will you find that the firm with the stronger CEO is the more successful of the two?...A correlation of .30 implies that you would find the stronger CEO leading the stronger firm in about 60% of the pairs—an improvement of a mere 10 percentage points over random guessing, 😨 hardly grist for the hero worship of CEOs we so often witness.[^3]

How does this self-indulgent, outsized picture of the importance of leaders translate into a bad judgments about business? Well, it could lead to unrealistic views about the extent to which leaders can shape the people in their organization.[^4]

For example, consider Simon Sinek's view on the this.[^5] At one point in [his leaders eat last talk](https://youtu.be/eP38Cxve5xY?t=35m55s), he says, "It's not the people. It's the environment. It's always the environment. The people are fine. It's always the environment." The context in which this extremely strong claim is made is an inspiring story in which a submarine captain makes a small change that supposedly results in his crew going from mediocre to the highest rated crew in naval history. ⚓️

Its a nice story, but what if, pace Sinek, _sometimes_ it's the people.[^6] In that case, because we've bought in to an outsized picture of our importance as leaders (because it feels nice), we've also bought in to an unrealistic view of the impact we can have on our people. This will lead to lots of wasted time trying to adjust an environment that won't actually result in significant improvements in people's performance. 

Now, don't get hung up on whether an overstated view of the importance of leadership actually leads to this mistaken judgment. This is just an example that's stuck with me because Sinek made such a strong claim. I'm not actually interested in that here. Again, I'm interested in what can be known about business in spite of the fact that these _types_ of mistakes are _likely_, given our imperfect information and imperfect minds. 

If you think leaders are uber important and that they can _always dramatically_ change the way their people behave, great. 👍 Just pick another example. Hopefully, I've said enough here to convince you that mistakes of self-indulgence can happen often and they can have non-trivial negative consequences on an organization.

In any case, here the demon metaphor/abstraction is especially apt. We can imagine the demon 😈 tempting us with beliefs that make us feel good. He says to us, "Yes. That's it. Doesn't that feel nice? Don't think critically here. You'll feel much better if you buy the interpretation of X that makes you feel good."

### The Demon's Causation Mirage

At one point in _Thinking Fast and Slow_, Kahneman asks us:

>A study of the incidence of kidney cancer in the 3,141 counties of the United States reveals a remarkable pattern. The counties in which the incidence of kidney cancer is lowest are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, the South, and the West. What do you make of this?[^7]

Go ahead. Think about this question yourself for a second.

If you're like me, you speculated as to why this pattern occurred. The speculation likely involves some sort of causal story about healthy, stress-free living in rural areas. Kahneman predicts 🔮 this error in his readers and then goes on to explain why it's an error:

>Now consider the counties in which the incidence of kidney cancer is highest. These ailing counties tend to be mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican 🐘 states in the Midwest, the South, and the West. Tongue-in-cheek, Wainer and Zwerling [authors of the study Kahneman is discussing] comment: “It is easy to infer that their high cancer rates might be directly due to the poverty of the rural lifestyle—no access to good medical care, a high-fat diet, and too much alcohol 🍻, too much tobacco.” Something is wrong, of course. The rural lifestyle cannot explain both very high and very low incidence of kidney cancer. The key factor is not that the counties were rural or predominantly Republican. It is that rural counties have small populations. And the main lesson to be learned is not about epidemiology, it is about the difficult relationship between our mind and statistics.[^8]

The correct answer to this question, it turns out, is that there is no plausible causal explanation for these two patterns. _These patterns occur by mere chance 🎲 because the populations of the counties are small._ Extreme outcomes like very high or very low incidence of kidney cancer are much more likely with small samples.[^9]

Its easy to imagine how this same sort of mistake could play out in books on business. A business writer (or even an experienced employee) could say, "I've implemented this solution twice before at my last two companies and it had X positive effect. Therefore, I'm confident we'll see the same thing if we implement the solution here." After the kidney cancer example, we know better than to take this argument seriously. The causal story according to which their solution reliably leads to some positive outcome is suspect because 2 is a small sample size.[^10]

So, to sum up this type of error in our judgment, we'll say that the demon creates "causal mirages." Descartes' demon could make us think there's "the sky, the air, the earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things" when in fact they were "merely dreams 😴...contrived as traps" for judgment. Our demon makes us see causation where there is only chance.

## "Knowledge" the demon takes

So what can be known about business given that we're prone to see causation where this only chance and given that we're prone to hear feel-good stories over information that actually helps us lead our teams and businesses? By pointing out mistakes in judgment, we've already hinted at some answers to this in the last section. So, let's make these hints more explicit. 

The demon definitely gets to take away what we think we know from the main-lessons of anecdote-based theories about how to lead businesses to success. There are plenty of examples of these, but some of the books that I've read or heard about recently that fall into this category are 

* _The Science of Growth_, in which Sean Ammirati, a business professor and genuinely impressive (I've heard him speak) serial entrepreneur from Carnegie Mellon, tries to derive a theory of what makes companies grow by looking at pairs of similar companies and seeing the difference between the successful and failed companies in those pairs. 

* _Good to Great_, in which Jim Collins basically tries to do the same thing Sean Ammirati does. _Good to Great_ is actually highly recommended by John Doer, partner at Kleiner Perkins and early investor in Google.[^11] [^12]

Another set of "fortune-telling" books that I've read also fall prey to demon's powers:

* _Exponential Organizations_, about how businesses of the future will operate.
* _The Inevitable_, a book by Kevin Kelly, the former editor of _Wired_ that says it'll help us understand "the twelve technological forces that will shape the next thirty years."
* _Thank You for Being Late_, a book by Thomas Friedman, the NYT writer, promises to help us thrive in "an age of accelerations" and attempts to identify important trends and predict how those trends will play out

Here's one more set of books that I've read that I've probably taken too seriously. These books are stories about the success of big companies and individuals. The big worry[^13] here is that these stories likely ignore the role of blind chance in explaining success and invite us to imagine causal relationships between the company culture at these companies and their success.[^14]

* _How Google Works_ (Google's story)
* _Into the Cloud_ (Salesforce's story)
* _The Everything Store_ (Amazon's story)
* _Elon Musk_ (Tesla and Space X's story)

## "you were just being naive": An Objection

At this point you might be thinking, "Fine, but this is really a trivial point. No one really thinks that the authors are expressing certain knowledge in these books." Fair, but we do think that these authors have a privileged perspective on these subjects and that's why we pay attention to them. 

This privileged perspective doesn't appear to survive the demon's shenanigans. At one point, Kahneman relays the result of a landmark 20-year study that's so shocking its worth quoting nearly in-full:

>Tetlock interviewed 284 people who made their living “commenting or offering advice on political and economic trends...Tetlock gathered more than 80,000 predictions...Respondents were asked to rate the probabilities of three alternative outcomes in every case: the persistence of the status quo, more of something such as political freedom or economic growth, or less of that thing.
>
>The results were devastating...people who spend their time, and earn their living, studying a particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart-throwing monkeys who would have distributed their choices evenly over the options. Even in the region they knew best, experts were not
significantly better than nonspecialists...
>
>"We reach the point of diminishing marginal predictive returns for knowledge disconcertingly quickly," Tetlock writes. "...there is no reason for supposing that contributors to top journals—distinguished political scientists, area study specialists, economists, and so on—are any better than journalists or attentive readers of The New York Times in reading our emerging situations."[^15]

There's little reason to think that folks who comment on emerging business trends or "leadership best practice" would fare any different in a task like this, especially since --- as Pfeffer has pointed out --- the predictions and recommendations of folks in this field are not often measured against reality.[^16]

## Conclusion

My claim here is _not_ that reading these books was a complete waste of time.[^17] Rather, the claim is that given, among other things[^18], our tendency to imagine causation where there is none and to accept and encounter what feels good rather than what is important, I don't think we have the foundation needed to make robust and reliable predictions about business trends or to make worthwhile claims about the relationship between quirky company cultures and those companys' _ultimate_ success or failure in their market.

There's probably value in studying a lot of the business-related content floating around, but whatever value there is in this study, it is not going to be found by _uncritical_ acceptance of the feel-good, causal stories we're sold in run-of-the-mill business-related content. That's not how to study business, and if we fail realize this, the Cartesian demon wins.

# Notes

[^1]: As someone who's flirted with content creation as a means of income myself, this point really resonated with me. There have definitely been times where I felt tempted to cover something that I didn't feel was particularly important simply because that's what would "sell." When Google announced that it'd be supporting Kotlin a few years ago at Google I/O, I felt that I should be writing a bunch of articles on Kotlin. The problem is that I didn't particularly feel that these articles were important or interesting. I thought it'd be more important and useful for me to write about testing, object oriented programming, and architecture, but alas, those topics weren't "hot" anymore.

[^3]: Daniel Kahneman, _Thinking Fast and Slow_, under the section called "Recipes for Success."

[^4]: There's actually another way we can arrive at this mistaken judgment that doesn't go through an exaggerated view of the importance of leaders. If Pfeffer is right that feel-good stories are over-represented and if Kahneman is right that we often use an "availability heuristic" when judging probabilities of an outcome, we could easily overestimate the chances that a leader can make a change to her environment that will significantly impact her people's performance because a story where this occurs is a lot easier to sell than a story where a leader is frustrated by repeated attempts to change her environment with no material improvement in performance.

[^5]: Pfeffer actually explicitly calls out Sinek with a chapter in his book called "Leaders Eat First."

[^6]: Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister, the authors of _Peopleware_ are closer actually have a nearly opposite view of Sinek. They say, "For most efforts, success or failure is in the cards from the moment the team is formed and the initial directions set out...managers are unlikely to change their people in any meaningful way. People don't usually stay put long enough, and the manager just doesn't have enough leverage to make a difference in their nature." Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister, _Peopleware_, 107-110.

[^7]: Daniel Kahneman, _Thinking Fast and Slow_, under the section called "The Law of Small Numbers."

[^8]: Ibid.

[^9]: Ibid. Kahneman explains this wonderfully by pointing out that it is much more likely that you'll draw all red or all white marbles from an urn containing half red and half white marbles if you're drawing 4 marbles rather than 8.

[^10]: The reader might object that there's a difference between the kidney cancer example and an example in which a person is constructing a causal story based on direct experience. However --- and this shouldn't really be a surprise --- it turns out that we can make the same kind of mistake even if we're directly experiencing the phenomenon we wish to explain. Kahneman's example of Israeli airforce commanders shows this. Because fighter pilots often performed worse after receiving praise and better after being scolded, they believed that negative feedback was more effective than positive feedback. Again, the pattern can be explained by mere chance and regression to the mean. You can find this under the section called "Regression to the Mean." We also see this same sort of thing play out in the debate between Malcom Gladwell and Steven Levitt over the "broken window theory" of crime.

[^11]: Doerr makes the Collins recommendation in his recent book _Measure what Matters_. 

[^12]: _Built to Last_, another one of Collins' books that takes the same pair-based approach actually gets called out explicitly by Kahneman as a book with a misguided approach. Ibid. under "Recipes for Success"
