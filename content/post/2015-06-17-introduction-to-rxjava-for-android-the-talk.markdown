Earlier today, I gave my Intro To RxJava talk. I'm not thrilled at how clear I was at explaining certain aspects of RxJava, but here's the video nonetheless. My talk starts at 28:32. Hopefully, I'll do a better job when I finish [the written version of this talk](http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2015/06/12/an-introduction-to-rxjava-for-android/).

If you want to hear a hilarious take down of the design of the new Pizza Hut app, check out [Ian's](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=51923912&trk=hp-feed-member-name) talk that happens before mine.

[Here](http://prezi.com/xby6mpyb_4uo/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy) are the slides that I used.

[Here's](https://github.com/kmdupr33/iosched/tree/feature/rxjava_rewrite) the source for the rxjava rewrite of the session search functionality. I'm particularly interested in what experienced RxJava-ers think of how I created an Observable from the SearchActivity's search widget text listener.
