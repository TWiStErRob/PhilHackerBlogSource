<blockquote>The Android community produces fantastic content.

Unfortunately, that content is scattered across various blogs, websites, email lists, etc. The dialog surrounding that content, moreover, is even more difficult to track down. As a result of this, finding high quality content that's been vetted by other expert Android developers is more difficult than it should be.

We believe that we can do better than this. We believe that the Android community can produce even better content if there's a central place for us to find, discuss, and evaluate the highest quality articles on Android development.

That's why we started Droid Journal</blockquote>


Droid Journal is a quarterly collection of peer-reviewed articles on Android development. We're currently calling for reviewers and authors for the fall 2015 edition. You can read more about it [here](http://www.droidjournal.com/).
