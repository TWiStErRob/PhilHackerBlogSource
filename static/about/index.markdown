My name is K. Matthew Dupree. I write about go development.

I'm a wannabe philosophy professor turned wannabe tech entrepreneur. I just graduated with my master's degree in philosophy from Tufts University, a school with one of the top philosophy programs in the country. I am currently working as a Software developer. You can read more about my transition from philosophy to hacking [here](http://philosophicalhacker.com/2014/04/21/why-im-glad-my-dream-job-didnt-work-out/).
